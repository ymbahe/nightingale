# All parameters should have CamelCase style keys. Do not use underscores
# in the parameter names (indicates nested dict structure in output Header).
# All parameters should have a comment indicating their meaning in the line(s)
# directly above them (unless it is obvious, e.g. 'Verbose'), and the 
# default value afterwards (which is purely for documentation purpose, the
# default value does not enter the code anywhere).
